Description: This assignment through the parent class, subclass and inheritance knowledge to achieve the app management function.
At the same time, I found that the traditional string method would judge the wrong situation without this type of apps, so I adopted
the StringBuilder method after asking my classmate. This is my first time using Github to upload a project, so please bear with me
if there is anything inappropriate.
